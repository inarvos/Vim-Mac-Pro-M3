My Vim configurations are tailored for simple text editing rather than coding. For coding purposes, I prefer using Neovim, which you can explore further at my Neovim repository: https://github.com/inarvos/Neovim-Mac-Pro-M3.



Features

These Vim configurations include standard text editor features, such as:
- Spelling Error Highlighting**: Integrated spell-checking to enhance text editing.
- Plugins**: A well-curated selection of plugins to extend Vim's functionality.
- Keybindings**: Custom key mappings for an optimized editing experience.
