My Vim configurations are tailored for simple text editing rather than coding. For coding purposes, I prefer using Neovim, which you can explore further at my Neovim repository: https://github.com/inarvos/Neovim-Mac-Pro-M3.

 


Features

These Vim configurations include standard text editor features, such as:
- Spelling Error Highlighting: Integrated spell-checking to enhance text editing;
- Plugins: A well-curated selection of plugins to extend Vim's functionality;
- Keybindings: Custom key mappings for an optimized editing experience.
